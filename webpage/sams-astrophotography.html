<h1>VENUS</h1>
<hr>

	<p>
		Venus is second from the Sun.  In ancient times it was called both the <b>Evening Star</b> and <b>Morning Star</b> because of how bright it is in the night sky.
		<br>
		Venus can be seen either during up to an hour after sunset or an hour before sunrise.
		<br>
		The images below are shots I have taken of the bright planet.  It's brightness is mainly due to its thick cloudy atmosphere which <b>reflects</b> the light.  Surprisingly, the planet is still cooked to a very high temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
	</p>

	<p>
		Venus shows phases like the Moon because it is in front of the Earth.  This means we are only able to see <b>part</b> of the lit face of the planet.

		There are times where the dark side <em>is</em> actually visible.  Some astronomers in history believed that this was because forest fires were lit by the planet's inhabitants every so often to appease their gods.

		Nowadays, we now know that is <em>not</em> the case.
